## üåü Overview

AI Stack Engineering brings the **Compounding Engineering Philosophy** to your development workflow. Each unit of work doesn't just complete a task‚Äîit teaches the system, making every subsequent task easier, faster, and higher quality.

This isn't just another AI coding assistant. It's a fundamental shift in how we build software:
- **Linear AI**: Helps with today's problem, starts fresh tomorrow
- **Compounding AI**: Learns from every interaction, applies patterns automatically, prevents entire categories of bugs

## üéØ Why This Exists

At [Digitalis.io](https://digitalis.io), we work with complex distributed systems daily. While AI assistants help with individual tasks, we needed something that:
- **Learns** from our specific tech stack patterns
- **Prevents** the bugs we've seen in production
- **Scales** our engineering expertise across the team
- **Compounds** knowledge over time, not just solves today's problem

This project customizes the brilliant [compounding engineering framework](https://github.com/EveryInc/every-marketplace) by [Every, Inc.](https://every.to) for our specific technology stack.

## üôè Attribution

**This project is based on [every-marketplace](https://github.com/EveryInc/every-marketplace) by Every, Inc.**

We are deeply grateful to [Kieran Klaassen](https://github.com/kieranklaassen) and the team at [Every](https://every.to) for creating the Compounding Engineering Philosophy and the original plugin framework. Their innovative vision of AI-powered development workflows inspired us to create this specialized version.

Our contribution focuses on adapting their framework for distributed systems engineering with our specific tech stack while maintaining the core philosophy that makes it powerful.

```

#### Method 2: Local Install (For Customization)
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/digitalis-io/ai-stack-engineering

# 2. Add marketplace from local path
claude /plugin marketplace add ./ai-stack-engineering

# 3. Install the plugin
claude /plugin install ai-stack-engineering

# 4. (Recommended) Install Context7 for up-to-date docs
claude mcp add --transport sse context7 https://mcp.context7.com/sse
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
/plugin list   # Should show ai-stack-engineering
/mcp list      # Should show Context7 (if installed)
/review        # Test the review command
```

### Your First Compounding Experience

```bash
# Plan a feature with AI research
claude /plan "Build Kafka consumer that writes to Cassandra"

# Execute the plan
claude /work

# Review with specialized agents
claude /review

# The magic: Next time you build something similar,
# the system already knows your patterns
```

### What This Really Means:

**Week 1:** 4 hours to build a feature (learning your patterns)
**Week 2:** 2 hours for similar complexity (applying patterns)
**Month 2:** 40 minutes for the same work (full compound effect)

The system learns:
- ‚úÖ Your code style and conventions
- ‚úÖ Your common bugs and how to prevent them
- ‚úÖ Your architecture patterns
- ‚úÖ Your tech stack quirks (Cassandra partitions, Kafka offsets, Go concurrency)

**The Result**: Not just faster development, but exponentially better code quality.

## ü§ñ Our Tech Stack Agents

### Specialized for Distributed Systems (6 Custom Agents)

#### `golang-reviewer`
*"I've debugged production at 3am. Make it obvious, make it work, make it fast‚Äîin that order."*
- Catches concurrency bugs, goroutine leaks, race conditions
- Enforces idiomatic Go patterns (Uber style guide)
- Production-ready error handling and observability

#### `java-craftsman`
*"I've seen AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean and lived. Keep it simple."*
- Prevents overengineering and enterprise anti-patterns
- Spring Boot configuration and best practices
- SOLID principles without the religion

#### `cassandra-guardian`

- Modern features: SAI indexes, vector search, UCS compaction
- Prevents unbounded partitions and tombstone disasters
- Data modeling that actually scales

#### `kafka-guardian`
*"At-least-once usually means at-least-twice. Let's fix that."*

## üìà Real-World Impact

### Metrics from Production Use (Every's Cora Email Product)

| Metric | Before | After 3 Months | Improvement |
|--------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Feature Delivery | 1-2 weeks | 1-3 days | **5-10x faster** |
| Bugs in Production | 15-20 per release | 3-5 per release | **75% reduction** |
| PR Review Time | 2-3 days | 2-4 hours | **10x faster** |
| Onboarding Time | 2-3 months | 1-2 weeks | **6x faster** |

### Expected Impact for Distributed Systems

- **Cassandra**: Prevent hot partitions before they happen
- **Kafka**: Eliminate data loss from offset mismanagement
- **Go Services**: Catch concurrency bugs in review, not production
- **React Apps**: Fix performance issues before users complain
- **Java/Spring**: Avoid enterprise pattern hell

## üí° Philosophy: The Mindset Shift

### Traditional Engineering
```
Fix bug ‚Üí Done
Write feature ‚Üí Done
Review code ‚Üí Done
```

### Compounding Engineering
```
Fix bug ‚Üí Test added ‚Üí Pattern recorded ‚Üí Category prevented
Write feature ‚Üí Pattern learned ‚Üí Reused automatically
Review code ‚Üí Standards extracted ‚Üí Applied forever
```

**Every bug becomes impossible to repeat.**
**Every review makes future code better.**
**Every feature becomes a reusable pattern.**
